// To customize the look and feel of Ionic, you can override
// the Sass variables found in Ionic's source scss files.


// App Color Variables
// ---------------------------------
// It's highly recommended to change the default colors
// to match your app's branding. Ionic uses a Sass map of
// colors so you can add, rename and remove colors as needed.
// The "primary" color is the only required color in the map.

// Any Sass variables that you want to override need to be done
// in this file, before Ionic's source scss files are imported.

$colors: (

  primary:    #387ef5,
  secondary:  #32db64,
  danger:     #f53d3d,
  light:      #f4f4f4,
  dark:       #222,
  favorite:   #4ba65f

);


// Ionic Sass
// ---------------------------------
@import "ionic";


// App Sass
// ---------------------------------
// It is recommended to do all of your imports in your files to let webpack build them
// in a module like manner.
// For example - instead of adding the @imports here, create a sass file 
// in ./tabs/tabs.scss - then @import your variables there, along with any custom styles.
// Webpack only rebuilds that specific sass file on changes, 
// and not the entire bundle, making rebuild times much faster for sass changes
